#### About the script:
- It takes a .tsv file and generates a quiz from that.
- It makes use of `fzf` to present options.
- You don't have to manually write options for every word. It will take 3 random choices ,1 answer and shuffle them again.

### About new-branch:
- It has extra files: *n4kanji.tsv , allWords.csv*
- quiz.sh has been modified accordingly.
- I manually add words to allWords.csv that I learn every day ; ~~I do use a script for this step~~
